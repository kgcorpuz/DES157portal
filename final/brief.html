            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                The project I will be updating is Studio 1: Mad Libs in which I will improve it by making it more interactive by adding more user input, illustrations and improving the overlay and buttons.

            <h2>Comparison</h2>
            <p>
                This site also uses the madlib layout that is similar to the experience of my final project. The element that I got inspired to include would be having a word random generator in case the user does not know what to put. I think it could be a fun feature added that can be implemented well. This is shown in the image they have a button that is distinguishable by it being a different color. 
            </p>

            </figure>

            <p>
                Something that they can improve on is making the user interface more attractive to interact with. They went on a simplistic route and does not have any fun illustrations.  It has a retro feel to the design. I like that they have a redo button that refreshes the page. In addition, I like that they highlighted the user imputed words that capture my attention.

            <h2>Project Goals</h2>
            <p>
                My goal for this project is to improve the user experience of playing madlibs. Small but useful details that were not included in my first version were buttons that helped with navigation. This relates to the content above because they have useful examples of how these buttons work correctly. In addition, my other goal is to make the user flow better by having more options to add to the form. It will add to the narrative of the story which this project does well.  
            </p>
            <p>
               Something that is different from the example site is that it will have more user elements they can play with. I love having these interactive elements to increase the fun of playing with the site that this site lacks.

            <h2>Design Strategies</h2>
            <p>
                The goal for this project is to improve the overlay and make the illustrations move too. I can turn the desserts to be gifs or have hover elements such as having cups swing when they hover over them. I will keep the color scheme of this cottage core style layout with the gingham background but will improve it. I want to work on improving the illustration by adding more to the desserts on the overlay.
            </p>
            <p>
                The typography chosen is a bubbly comforting font since it has a playful style to the project. I will work on the layout for there to be nice symmetry to be visually appealing. The continuity amongst the project will be the implementation of character design in each overlay.

            <h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>
            <p>
                One interactive element will be this madlib is a form so there is user input for each word. There will be a random button generator the user can click on if they are stumped too which needs an array of backup words. In addition, I can add more cafe elements to deepen the narrative of my project. I can add a timed animation that pops up first to introduce the character. In addition, the dessert images will be more interactive with the user too by either being moving gifs or having coded hover elements that make a piece of dessert move. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                There will also be more naviational buttons incorporated to make the experience easier to go back to the first page or make the overlay remove easily.  
            </p>

            <h2>Expeience Goals</h2>
            <p>
                I want the user to fall in love with the character design of Clarence the barista bear. I will achieve this by making the illustrations more interactive. I can also add him to the header of him moving too. In addition, I want to have music elements and sounds incorporated into this project to increase the cafe experience such as clinking of coffee cups and having a sound when they submit the madlib too. My goal is to reach the audience and create a cozy experience to help them destress and have a laugh. I am excited to progress this work and add more details because I really enjoy this concept! :)
