            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                During this stage, I asked people to test out using this madlib. This is a compilation of observations that arose during these test and feedback connected to their experiences.

            <h2>Observation 1</h2>
            <p>
                An action that I noticed was that it took a long time for users to think about certain words to choose from. I asked if the having examples would be helpful or if there needed to be a clarification with the word choice for the prompt. The feedback showed that having a more specific prompt would be better for thinking of words that match the comic better. I could also readjust some of the wording to make the story clearer for the audience.

            <h2>Observation 2</h2>
            <p>
                Another observation that was noted was the interaction with the first pannel. Many users were confused with what they should do since Clarence's speech bubble was empty. A couple times people clicked or hover for an interaction to occur. This pannel can be used to enhance the experience by starting to play music when they click on Clarence. An alternative would be when they hover over a surprise can show.

            <h2>Observation 3</h2>
            <p>
                While reading the comic, the color of the madlib word really jumps out to the user. A user mentioned that although the word is noticeable, it does not fit well with the overall theme. This will be adjusted further so that it pops out clearly, but is also cohesive with the theme. They really want to match the overall design.

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                Overall, the user tests were super helpful with catching instances that were overlooked in the process in designing. It was super helpful with seeing if certain layout choices were legible and successful with conveying the storytelling process. The things that I want to improve on for the next version would be to be specific in the prompts for the madlib. I also want to fix the first pannel interaction into becoming a hover transition that shows a surprise. Finally, I want to adjust the color contrast of the madlib to make a cohesive project and add cafe music that fits the warm and comforting design.
