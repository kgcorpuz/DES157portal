            <date>January 31, 2023</date>
            <p>In this <a href=https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f> article</a> Ansari highlights key aspects that many forms lack and how to improve them. One highlight from the reading is to reduce as much confusion as possible by correctly labeling and putting examples outside the boxes. In addition, the sizes each submission should make the info that is needed.
            </p>

            <p>
            It is also beneficial to know what features to add such as replacing a drop down with selection bubbles to make the user experience easier to interact with. Working on making designs accessible is one of the most important tips to remember, so always check contrat and text sizing to be legible for all users. 
            </p>

            <p>A site that has these tips implemented in their form layout is Mailchimp's signup page. They have correct format for labels outside the boxes to make it clear for users. Also, they have pop-up explanations when entering the username as a suggestion. The clean layout follows all the princlipes from this article well to have a smooth on-boarding experience. </p>
